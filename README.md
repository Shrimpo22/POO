## FireFight
Firefight is a simple 2D game where you control a fireman and have to douse the fires before they spread!
The game has a scoring system rewarding you for every fire you extinguish and for each tree you can protect!

You also have a bouldozer so you can remove trees to ensure the fire doesn't spread!

You have to be careful for Fuel Barrels! If they catch on fire they'll explode setting nearby trees on fire!

In some levels you'll also have the help of fellow fireman!

Sometimes the firetruck will also be available so you can douse more fires at once!
